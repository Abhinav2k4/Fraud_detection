This project is a Fraud Detection system built using Python and Machine Learning. It uses a Random Forest Classifier to detect fraudulent financial transactions in a highly imbalanced dataset.
Since fraud detection requires prioritizing recall over accuracy, the model was evaluated using precision, recall, F1-score, and a confusion matrix.
The model achieved very high overall accuracy (~99.9%) but more importantly, it reached a recall of ~85% for fraudulent cases, making it effective at identifying fraud.
The dataset used for training is very large and cannot be uploaded to GitHub due to size limitations, but it can be downloaded separately from Kaggle.
This project demonstrates key steps in data preprocessing, handling imbalance, model training, and evaluation, and can be further extended with advanced models or deployed as an API.
